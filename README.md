# Prediction of Football Match Result

## Objective:
To predict the winner of a football match using machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis of live tweets.

## Methodology:

### Data Collection:
Data for this project was collected from various sources such as FIFA World Cup archives, team and player statistics, and live tweets during matches. The dataset included information such as team rankings, past performance, player injuries, and weather conditions.

### Model Building:
A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was developed to predict the winner of the match based on the available statistics. The model was trained on historical data and validated using cross-validation techniques. The accuracy of the model was 83.8%, which was considered satisfactory.

### Sentiment Analysis:
In addition to statistical analysis, live tweets during the match were also collected and analyzed using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The tweets were cleaned, pre-processed and classified into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. This information was used to identify the sentiment of the fans towards each team during the match.

### Results:
The SVM model was successful in predicting the winner of the match with high accuracy. The addition of sentiment analysis provided valuable insights into the emotions of the fans during the match, which could be used for further analysis and decision making.

### Conclusion:
The use of machine learning techniques and sentiment analysis can be useful in predicting the outcome of football matches. This project demonstrates the potential of such techniques in the sports industry and can be extended to other sports and events as well.
